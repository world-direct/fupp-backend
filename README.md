## Deployment

### Development Deployment with Docker-Compose

- Open solution in Visual Studio
- Build Solution

You can start the backend of Fupp in a development environment either via Visual Studio or manually via Docker CLI.

#### Visual Studio

To run Fupp in Visual Studio, set docker-compose as StartUp project and Run solution as Docker in Toolbar. Visual Studio opens the WebApi site automatically in your browser.

#### Docker Command Line
Use the following command to run Fupp in PowerShell/CMD:

    docker-compose  -f "docker-compose.yml" -f "docker-compose.override.yml" -f "obj\Docker\docker-compose.vs.debug.g.yml"  up -d --build

This command merges the base compose files `docker-compose.yml` and the override filed `docker-compose.override.yml` with the compose file `docker-compose.vs.debug.g.yml` generated by Visual Studio for the debugging environment and starts Fupp detached.

To open the WebApi site in your browser, the IP address of the webapi container has to be determined by the following command:

    docker inspect -f "{{ .NetworkSettings.Networks.nat.IPAddress }}" fuppbackend_webapi_1


To stop Fupp execute

    docker-compose down
